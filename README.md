# Karina's Spotify

As one of my first personal projects, I wanted to download my own Spotify data and dive into my listening habits. After sharing some insights to my friend, Karina, she told me she wanted to take a look at her data as well. I offered to analyze it for her so that she can have a more simplified outlook of her music experience, while I can gain more practice in dealing with large datasets and working through them with Google Sheets, Google BigQuery, and Tableau. It was a win, win!

After receiving all the relevant downloads of Karina's Spotify data, I converted the JSON files to CSV.
I then uploaded each file to Google Sheets and combined all files of data into one large sheet. This came to a staggering total of 43,767 rows (after cleaning the data)!
